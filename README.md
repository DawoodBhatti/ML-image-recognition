**Actionable Plan: Custom 2D Pose Estimation Framework**

1. Decide on Backbone Architecture
✅ Choose a deep learning model to extract keypoints from images.

- Options: ResNet, MobileNet (efficient), HRNet (high accuracy), ViT (transformer-based)

- Since speed isn’t critical, HRNet or a transformer-based model might be best for detailed keypoint detection.

- Experiment with pre-trained models first before training from scratch.
  

**2. Confirm Pose Estimation Type**
✅ Use 2D pose estimation to simplify animation keyframe extraction.

- 2D is ideal for stylized animations, while 3D-to-2D conversion can sometimes look unnatural.

- Plan how to handle depth if needed (e.g., inferred depth cues via shading).
  

**3. Collect and Train on Open-Source Datasets**
✅ Use existing open-source datasets to train the initial model.

- COCO, MPII, Human3.6M (if experimenting with depth cues), SportsPose (if sports-based).

- Preprocessing steps: resize, normalize, augment for better generalization.

✅ Fine-tune with manual corrections

- Draw your own sketches to refine outputs towards your art style.

- Store corrections in a structured format (JSON or custom annotation format).

- Implement active learning, where the model asks for feedback on low-confidence predictions.
  

**4. Develop Visualization & Animation Export System**
✅ Skeleton visualization

 - Use OpenCV, Matplotlib, or Pygame to display pose outputs.

- Overlay joints and bones based on manually drawn connections.

✅ Animation export for Godot

- Store pose sequences in JSON or BVH (if considering deeper animation tools).

- Use GDScript in Godot to process and animate poses.

✅ Smooth Motion Interpolation

- Apply Bezier curves or Kalman filters to transition between pose frames smoothly.

- If handling full video sequences, use temporal models (LSTM, Transformer-based smoothing).


**5. Deployment & Scalability**
✅ Create a web service to process pose data

- Use FastAPI or Flask to host your model as an API.

- Accept image or video uploads and return processed skeleton data.

✅ Plan for batch video processing

- Structure the pipeline to handle full video sequences instead of single frames.

- Optimize for batch inference using PyTorch or TensorFlow-serving.

✅ Consider future extensibility

- Modular code structure to allow easy expansion to 3D pose estimation later.

- Plugin system for alternative skeleton formats or smoothing methods.
